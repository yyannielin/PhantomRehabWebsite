                    This app aims to provide patients with a research-based way to aid in completion of sensorimotor exercises for phantom limb syndrome and chronic pain using three types of therapy techniques that address the neurobiopsychosocial aspects of these syndromes. 
    <br><br>
    <b>Laterality reconstruction</b><br>
    The beginner level provides interactive Q&A for quizzing the patient, asking them to select left or right upon an image prompt.  
    Targets neurologic connections between the brain and the missing limb by having you identify body images as either left or right.  
    By practicing this technique, your brain uses its movement planning areas to start normalizing messages between the brain and body.
    Keep in mind that the Q&As are not a "test" – they can actually be fun! Try your best to not become frustrated if you are not a pro at this exercise at first. Recovery takes time and is not linear. Go easy on yourself and know that you are working toward progress. :)
    <br><br>
    The intermediate level provides a video prompt of somebody moving their hand, and guides the patient to imagine pain-free movement on their hand.
    <br><br>
    <b>Graded Motor Imaging</b><br>
    The hard level provides a mirror therapy based on principles of Graded Motor Imaging, which involves viewing the unaffected limb in a mirror, while keeping the residual limb out of sight.
    The brain has "maps" of the body and when an amputation happens, those maps no longer match the sensory and motor signals from the body. Graded Motor Imagery training techniques cause the brain to “re-think” the pain response that it has been experiencing since the amputation and adopt the image of the healthy hand in place of the injured limb.</p>
